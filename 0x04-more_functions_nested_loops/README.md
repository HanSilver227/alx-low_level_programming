* Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);



[3-print_numbers.c](./3-print_numbers.c)



* Prototype: void print_numbers(void);

* You can only use _putchar twice in your code



[4-print_most_numbers.c](./4-print_most_numbers.c)



* Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);

* Do not print 2 and 4

* You can only use _putchar twice in your code



[5-more_numbers.c](./5-more_numbers.c)



*  Prototype: void more_numbers(void);

* You can only use _putchar three times in your code



[6-print_line.c](./6-print_line.c)



* Prototype: void print_line(int n);

* You can only use _putchar function to print

* Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed

* The line should end with a \n

* If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n



[7-print_diagonal.c](./7-print_diagonal.c)



* Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n);

* You can only use _putchar function to print

* Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed

* The diagonal should end with a \n

* If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n



[8-print_square.c](./8-print_square.c)



* Prototype: void print_square(int size);

* You can only use _putchar function to print

* Where size is the size of the square

* If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line

* Use the character # to print the square



[9-fizz_buzz.c](./9-fizz_buzz.c)



* But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the

  multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and

  five print FizzBuzz.



* Each number or word should be separated by a space

* You are allowed to use the standard library



[10-print_triangle.c](./10-print_triangle.c)



* Prototype: void print_triangle(int size);

* You can only use _putchar function to print

* Where size is the size of the triangle

* If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line

* Use the character # to print the triangle



[100-prime_factor.c](./100-prime_factor.c)



* You are allowed to use the standard library

* Your program will be compiled with this command: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -

* Wextra 100-prime_factor.c -o 100-prime_factor -lm



[101-print_number.c](./101-print_number.c)



* Prototype: void print_number(int n);

* You can only use _putchar function to print

* You are not allowed to use long

* You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers

* You are not allowed to hard-code special values
